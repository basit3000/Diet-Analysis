🚀 How to Use

    Prepare a Google Sheet with or use the Example Diet Analysis excel sheet by uploading to Google sheets:

        Column A: Food item names (e.g., from A2 to A31)

        Column B: Calories per 100g for each item

        Column E: Protein per 100g for each item

        Column B (Sheet 2): Rows 2–8 reserved for Monday–Sunday calorie logs

        Column E (Sheet 2): Rows 2-8 reserved for Monday-Sunday protein logs

        Column A (Sheet 3): Rows 2-1000 reserved for days of the year

        Column C (Sheet 3): Rows 2-1000 corresponding to the days column; the total caloric amount
 
        Column G (Sheet 3): Rows 2-1000 corresponding to the days column; the total protein amount

        Column I (Sheet 3): Rows 2-1000 current weight of the day in column A

        If you want to upload to Google Sheets:

        1. Go to Google Sheets

        2. Click on Blank spreadsheet
        
        3. Click on Open > Upload > Example Diet Analysis.xlsx

        4. Click Open

    Update the environment variable or use the example.env:

    Run the app: python main.py

    Select a food, enter grams, and click Add.

        Calories are calculated and added to your Google Sheet under the correct weekday.

        A timestamped entry is saved to diet_log.txt.

🧠 Summary

    Calorie Calculation:
    Calories = (grams / 100) * calories_per_100g
    Protein = (grams / 100) * protein_per_100g

    Sheet Update:
    Calories and Protein are added to column B and E of sheet 2 at the rows corresponding to the current weekday.

    Logging:
    Each entry is appended to diet_log.txt with timestamp.
